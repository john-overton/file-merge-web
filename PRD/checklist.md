# LLM Development Checkpoints

## Checkpoint 1: Project Foundation
- [x] Base project setup (Node.js + TypeScript + React)
- [x] Tailwind configuration
- [x] Main application layout component
- [x] Basic routing structure
- [x] Test the build process

## Checkpoint 2: File Import

- [x] CSV/XLSX file reading logic
- [x] File preview grid component
- [x] Basic error handling
- [x] Test with sample files

## Checkpoint 3: Data Mapping Foundation
- [x] Source/target column display
- [x] Basic mapping interface
- [x] Data type detection
- [x] Preview mapped data
- [x] Test mapping functionality

## Checkpoint 4: Transformation Rules
- [x] Data type conversion system
- [x] Basic transformations (string, number, date)
- [x] Transformation preview
- [x] Validation rules
- [x] Test transformations

## Checkpoint 5: Export System
- [x] Export configuration interface
- [x] CSV/XLSX generation
- [x] Export preview
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Test export functionality

## Checkpoint 6: Project Management
- [x] Save/load configurations
- [x] Project settings
- [x] Error logging
- [x] Test configuration persistence

## Testing Strategy
After each checkpoint:
1. Verify core functionality
2. Test error handling
3. Check UI responsiveness
4. Validate data integrity
5. Document any limitations

## Development Flow
1. Request base component code
2. Review and refine
3. Request integration code
4. Test functionality
5. Move to next checkpoint

## Notes
- Each checkpoint should be fully functional before moving on
- Components should be tested independently
- Keep error handling simple but effective
- Focus on core functionality first
- Document LLM-specific limitations
